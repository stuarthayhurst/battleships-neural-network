## battleships-neural-network
  - A simple game of battleships, with a neural-network powered opponent
  - This project was created as coursework for my Computer Science A-Level, and isn't designed to actually be used
    - Because of this, this repository is mostly a just code dump, in case anyone finds anything useful
  - This project contains all the battleships-related parts of the project, not the actual neural network
    - The code for the neural network can be found [here](https://github.com/stuarthayhurst/neural-network-playground)

## Dependencies:
  - `python3`
  - `numpy`
  - `GTK 3` (Python 3 bindings)

## Setup:
  - `git clone https://github.com/stuarthayhurst/neural-network-playground.git`
  - `mv neural-network-playground neural_network`
