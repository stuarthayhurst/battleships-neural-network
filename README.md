## battleships-neural-network
  - A simple game of battleships, with a neural-network powered opponent
  - This project was created as coursework for my Computer Science A-Level, and isn't designed to actually be used
    - Since this was written under time pressure, the quality is mostly awful
    - Because of this, this repository is mostly a just code dump, in case anyone finds anything useful

## Dependencies:
  - `python3`
  - `numpy`
  - `GTK 3` (Python 3 bindings)
