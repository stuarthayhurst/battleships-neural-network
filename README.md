## neural-network-playground
  - A repository to experiment with neural networks for my A-Level computer science coursework
  - Written in Python, and potentially will be GPU accelerated with C++ and OpenGL
  - The beginning of the commit history will likely be a mess, as this repository is for experiments
    - I'll clean it up later, around the time it's made public
